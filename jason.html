        <section class="content">
        <p>Recently retired from the U.S. Army after 15 years, I have set my sights
           on a new career in software engineering.</p>
        <p>In my free time (which is slim to none with a 10 month
           old baby at home), I enjoy flying my DJI Phantom 3 drone,
           watching sports on television, and spending time with my
           family. When not doing any of those things, I am coding,
           honing my newfound skills and craft.</p>

        <p>Thank you for visiting my page. Please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>
           if you have any questions or projects you would like me to look at.</p>
