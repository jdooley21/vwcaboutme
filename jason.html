      <p class="bio">Recently retired from the U.S. Army after
         almost 15 years of service, I have set my sights
         on a career in Software Engineering after realizing
         that a job doesn't come easy just because you have
         the title "Veteran" next to your name. I have come to realize that
         "skills pay the bills".</p>

      <p class="bio">After being honorably discharged and given medical
         retirement from the Army, I spent the last 14 months looking for
         viable employment. I tried to sell solar panels for two weeks. I worked
         as a mail carrier for a month. Finally, I found myself working as a
         hardware technician at Google. It was here that I realized my calling
         is on the software side. I want to build resources for military
         veterans that suffer from PTSD. My longterm goal is to build a company
         that specializes in finding resources for those with PTSD and providing
         a community that enables meetings, camaraderie, and shows the Veterans
         that somebody cares about them.</p>

      <p class="bio">In my free time (which is slim to none with a 10 month
         old baby at home), I enjoy flying my DJI Phantom 3 drone,
         watching sports on television, and spending time with my
         family. When not doing any of those things, I am coding,
         honing my newfound skills and craft.</p>
